# SCILLA

SCILLA is a software for automated discovery of superconducting circuits.
It provides a closed-loop implementation of circuit design, property computation, and merit evaluation.
The software and its scientific application are described in ref [1].
Implementation details and examples are provided in the supplementary information of the manuscript.



### Requirements

This code has been tested with Python 3.6 on Unix platforms.
The required packages are listed in the `environment.yml` file.


### Disclaimer

Note: This repository is under construction. We hope to add further details on the method, instructions and more examples in the near future. 


### Experiencing problems?
